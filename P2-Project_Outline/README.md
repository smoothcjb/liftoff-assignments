## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The main function of my web application will be to provide users with a tool to record their hours worked.
Some of the planned features are listed below. My motivation for this application was generated from working for a small 
company that has a manual process for capturing employee hours for payroll. Aside from having an automated time clock, users 
would more that likely find the calculation of their total hours worked to be very useful.

* Record time in/time out
* Calculate the total hours for a workday
* Provide access to pay stubs 
* Search totals by date
* Export payroll totals to a CSV file
### Technologies
C#
ASP.NET Core
